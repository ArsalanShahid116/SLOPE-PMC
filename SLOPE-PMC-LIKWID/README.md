SLOPE-PMC-LIKWID is an automated tool for collecting Performance Monitoring Counters <br />
(PMCs) on Intel Haswell based multicore server by using LIKWID. <br />

You can find more details about LIKWID and installation @ https://github.com/RRZE-HPC/likwid. 

"Haswell-E5-2670-denergy-pmcs.csv" contains raw data of dynamic energy consumption <br />
calculated via real-time hardware power meter (WattsUp Pro) by using HCLWattsUp API <br />
against PMCs collected via SLOPE-PMC. The application set include Nas Parallel Benchmarks,<br />
Stress, Rodinia, Intel MKL, and HPCG for a variety of inputs. The first record in each <br />
line is dynamic energy consumption and rest show PMC counts. <br />

You can access HCLWattsUP API @ https://git.ucd.ie/hcl/hclwattsup.<br />
